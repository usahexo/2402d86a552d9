The ranking of hands in Texas Hold'Em is pretty simple. The best hand possible is a Royal Flush, followed by a Straight Flush, then Four of a Kind, then a Full House, then a Flush, then a Straight, then Three of a Kind, then Two Pair, and finally, One Pair.

Order of Cards

When it comes to the order of cards, there are two things that you need to remember. The first is that the Ace always ranks high, and the second is that suits are irrelevant. This means that the highest card in any given hand will be the Ace if there is one, and if not then the highest card will be the King. From there, the order of cards goes 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K.
