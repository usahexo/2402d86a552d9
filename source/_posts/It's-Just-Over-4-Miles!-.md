#  It's Just Over 4 Miles! 

Are you one of those people who believes that anything over a mile is too much distance to run? If so, it's time to rethink your attitude because running four miles is nothing! In fact, this distance is perfect for beginners who are just getting into running or for those who are looking for a new challenge.

If you're not convinced yet, consider these reasons why running four miles is a great goal:

1. It's not too long or too short. This distance strikes the perfect balance and allows runners to feel like they've accomplished something without feeling overwhelmed.

2. It's an achievable goal. Even if you're not a seasoned runner, you can still complete four miles. And once you do, you'll be one step closer to completing a longer race.

3. It builds endurance. The more often you run four-mile races, the easier it will become to complete them. This will help prepare you for longer distances down the road.

4. It's a good way to start your day. Running early in the morning can jumpstart your metabolism and set the tone for the rest of your day. Plus, it's a great way to clear your head before work or school starts.

5. It keeps you healthy. Running is one of the best exercises out there because it strengthens your heart and lungs while also helping to improve your overall mood state. So why not give it a try?

#  A Short Drive to the Casino 

I was born and raised in Las Vegas, so I'm no stranger to the casino scene. However, when I relocated to Reno a few years ago, I quickly realized how much of a drive it is to get to the casinos. In Las Vegas, the casinos are practically in your backyard. You can literally walk to them from just about anywhere in the city. But in Reno, you're looking at a 30-minute drive, at least.

Despite the long drive, I've made the trip to Reno's casinos many times. And I always enjoy myself once I arrive. There's something about the excitement of gambling that just gets my blood flowing. Plus, the casino floors are always full of interesting people to watch.

If you're looking for a fun night out, or some excitement in your life, I highly recommend making the trip to a Reno casino. Just be sure to budget enough time for the drive!
