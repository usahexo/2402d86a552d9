#  Chargers to Play in NFL's First Billion-Dollar Stadium

The NFL and Chargers have announced that the team will play in a new billion-dollar stadium in 2020. The stadium, to be funded by the NFL and the Chargers, will be located in Carson, California.

The new stadium is part of the NFL's plan to increase revenues. By 2020, the league plans to have at least four stadiums that cost more than $1 billion each. The NFL has already approved three other stadiums that will exceed that amount: the Atlanta Falcons' Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the Los Angeles Rams' Inglewood Stadium, and the Miami Dolphins' Sun Life Stadium.

The Chargers' move to Los Angeles has been met with mixed reactions. Some people are excited about the prospect of a new state-of-the-art stadium, while others view it as a corporate giveaway to a wealthy team. Regardless of how you feel about it, there's no doubt that this new stadium will be a major attraction for LA residents and tourists alike.

#  Why the Chargers Are a Good Bet for the 2017 Season

The Chargers have always been a good team, but they have never been able to make it to the Super Bowl. However, this could be their year. Here are four reasons why the Chargers are a good bet for the 2017 season:

1. Phillip Rivers is a Great QB

Phillip Rivers is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. He has led the Chargers to some great seasons in the past, and there is no reason to believe that he can't do it again this year.

2. The Chargers Have a Good Offense

The Chargers have a good offense with players like Melvin Gordon and Keenan Allen. This offense can easily score points against any team in the NFL.

3. The Chargers Have a Good Defense

The Chargers also have a good defense, which is important if they want to make it to the Super Bowl. Some of their top defenders include Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram.

4. The AFC Is Wide Open

The AFC is wide open this year, and there is no clear-cut favorite to win it all. This gives the Chargers a chance to make it to the Super Bowl if they play well throughout the season.

#  Is Los Angeles Ready for Another NFL Team?

The Los Angeles Rams are back in the City of Angels after spending the last 22 years in St. Louis. The Rams’ return has sparked renewed interest in football in Los Angeles, with fans eager to see if the team can recapture its former glory.

With football fever heating up in LA, some people are beginning to ask whether the city is ready for another NFL team. There is no doubt that Los Angeles is a big enough market to support two teams, but there are a few potential roadblocks that could prevent another team from moving to LA.

The first obstacle is finding a stadium. The Rams are playing at the Los Angeles Coliseum until their new stadium is completed in 2019, but there is no suitable stadium available for a second team. A number of potential stadiums have been proposed, including the San Diego Chargers’ former home of Qualcomm Stadium and StubHub Center in Carson, but none of them have gained much traction.

The other obstacle is money. A new NFL team would need to come up with an estimated $2 billion to join the league, and it’s unclear where that money would come from. There are some wealthy individuals who might be interested in owning a team, but it’s unlikely that they would want to spend that much money without government assistance.

Despite these obstacles, there is still a chance that another NFL team could move to LA. The Oakland Raiders have been mentioned as a possible candidate, and they could be looking for a new home if they don’t get a new stadium deal done in Oakland. The Raiders would be a good fit for LA, and they could even share the Rams’ new stadium when it’s completed.

So far, there has been no official movement on bringing another NFL team to LA, but the possibility remains open. Football fans inLA are just happy that the Rams are back home where they belong.

#  Chargers' Move to L.A. Expected to Boost Ticket Sales

The Los Angeles Chargers are expected to have a bumper year when it comes to ticket sales, as the team makes its long-awaited return to the city.

After more than two decades in San Diego, the Chargers announced in January that they would be moving to L.A. The decision was met with some controversy, but it is now clear that the NFL franchise is poised for a successful relaunch in its new home.

According to experts, the Chargers should see a significant increase in ticket sales this season. Not only is there renewed excitement about the team after its move, but interest in professional football is also on the rise in L.A. In fact, the Rams – who relocated to L.A. from St. Louis two years ago – saw their ticket sales jump by 50 percent last season.

For diehard fans of the Chargers, buying tickets may seem like a no-brainer. But even those who are less invested in the team may be swayed by the opportunity to see an NFL game live at the iconic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. With both the Rams and Chargers playing at home this season, there’s sure to be a lot of action happening at that stadium!

So if you’re looking for something fun to do this fall, consider catching a game at the Coliseum – it’s sure to be a spectacle!
