#  MLB’s new casino affiliate is looking for fresh marketing and sponsorship opportunities!

The MGM Resorts’ new ownership of the Las Vegas 51s, Triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets, has sports business observers buzzing with possibilities for new marketing and sponsorship opportunities for the team.

MGM recently acquired the team from casino mogul and real estate developer Frank Urbano. The move comes as MGM prepares to open a $1.4 billion resort and casino, called “The Park,” adjacent to the New York-New York Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip this fall.

According to Dave Matejczyk, president of Matejczyk Sports & Entertainment, a sponsorship and marketing consultancy, the new affiliation could mean some fresh opportunities for brands looking to reach baseball fans in Las Vegas.

“There’s no question that this affiliation is going to give MGM a lot of visibility with baseball fans in Las Vegas,” Matejczyk said. “It will be interesting to see if they can parlay that into some new marketing and sponsorship opportunities with local businesses.”

Some possible sponsorships that could be pursued include deals with restaurants and nightclubs near the stadium, as well as deals with local auto dealers and homebuilders. MGM could also look to get involved in youth baseball programs in the area.

In addition to marketing and sponsorship opportunities, the new affiliation could also lead to more cross-promotions between the Mets and 51s. For example, the Mets could send some of their top prospects on rehab assignments to play for the 51s in Las Vegas.

#  MLB moves on from brick and mortar casinos, to online gambling with new affiliate
Major League Baseball has reached a deal with Sportradar to become its official provider of live sports betting data in the United States. The multi-year agreement, announced on Monday, gives Sportradar the exclusive rights to distribute MLB data for "in-game" betting to licensed sports books in the country. 

The agreement is a blow to Las Vegas casinos, which had been counting on MLB games to attract bettors away from online gambling sites. It also comes as the NBA moves toward its own official deal with Sportradar, which could impact that league's relationship with Caesars Entertainment, one of the largest casino operators in the country.

Sportradar is a global sports data and analytics company. The company has a live betting product that it currently sells to more than 400 customers in 40 countries. In addition to baseball and basketball, Sportradar provides data for soccer, ice hockey, American football and tennis.

The deal comes as states across the country are moving to legalize sports betting. New Jersey, which won a U.S. Supreme Court case last year allowing it to legalize gambling in its casinos and racetracks, began offering legal sports betting on June 14th. Delaware followed suit later that month and West Virginia earlier this week. 

MLB had been opposed to legalized sports betting but softened its stance last year after the Supreme Court ruling. Under the new agreement, Sportradar will provide MLB with detailed data including game information, inning-by-inning wagering odds and results. 

In a statement announcing the deal, Bob Bowman, CEO of MLBAM said: "This partnership furthers our commitment to protecting the integrity of our sport while providing fans enhanced product offerings through our partners." 

Brian Herbstman, Sportradar's US general counsel said: "Our mission is to make live betting available everywhere people want to bet on sports... This partnership allows us do just that - bringing the excitement of baseball's in-game action to Sportsbooks across the country."

#  MLB welcomes new casino affiliate with open arms

Major League Baseball has welcomed a new casino affiliate with open arms, despite concerns from some of its players about the potential for gambling-related corruption.

The new agreement, announced this week, will see the casino become the official gaming partner of MLB, giving it exclusive access to league data and branding opportunities. In return, the casino will make a "multi-million dollar" donation to MLB's youth baseball and softball initiatives.

While some players have voiced concerns about possible match-fixing or performance-enhancing drug use stemming from increased exposure to gambling, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred insisted that the sport's integrity would not be compromised.

"Our fans can be confident that our games will continue to be played fairly and with integrity," he said. "We have taken steps to ensure that our players and staff are fully educated on the risks associated with gambling and are aware of our strong anti-corruption policies."

It's not yet clear whether the new agreement will lead to any changes in how MLB approaches betting on its games, but it's expected that the casino will now have a seat at the table when rule changes are discussed. That could pave the way for more widespread legal gambling on MLB games in the future.

#  How will MLB's new casino affiliate affect the sport?

The Vegas Golden Knights are a professional ice hockey team based in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team began play in the 2017–18 NHL season.

On November 21, 2017, it was announced that MGM Resorts International had reached an agreement with the NHL to become the league's first official casino affiliate. As part of the agreement, MGM would become the exclusive casino partner of both the Golden Knights and the New York Rangers, and would also receive marketing rights to all 31 NHL teams.

The deal has been met with criticism by some who argue that it gives MGM an unfair advantage over other casinos in Las Vegas, as well as concerns that it could lead to match-fixing or other corruption in NHL games. However, others believe that it will help boost tourism for Las Vegas and provide more exposure for the Golden Knights.
