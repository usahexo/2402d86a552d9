# 4. What are the bonus terms at 1xbet?

A 1xbet bonus is a promotional offer that allows you to receive extra funds to your account.  To be able to get the bonus, you need to make a deposit and enter the special code. The amount of the bonus depends on the sum you have deposited.

There are a few important things to bear in mind when taking advantage of a 1xbet bonus:

1. Winnings from using a bonus are subject to wagering requirements. This means that you will need to bet through your bonus funds a certain number of times before you can withdraw them as cash. The wagering requirement for bonuses can vary so always check the terms and conditions before signing up.

2. You cannot combine two or more bonuses into one account. For example, if you claim a deposit bonus and a free bet bonus, you will only be able to use one of them.

3. Bonuses are usually released in stages as you complete certain wagering requirements. Make sure you check how your bonus is released so that you know what you need to do in order to access all of the funds.

4. Always read the terms and conditions carefully before signing up for a bonus as there may be some restrictions on what games you can play with your bonus funds or which countries are eligible for the promotion.

# You can get a bonus of up to €100 when you sign up and make your first deposit. However, there are certain terms and conditions that you must meet in order to be eligible for the bonus. Be sure to read the full terms and conditions on the 1xbet website before signing up.

# The bonus is a 100% match of your first deposit, up to a maximum of €100. In order to be eligible for the bonus, you must make a minimum deposit of €10.

# The bonus is only available for new customers who have not previously registered with 1xbet. It is not available for customers who have an existing account with 1xbet.

# The bonus must be wagered 10 times before it can be withdrawn. This means that you must wager a total of €1,000 before you can withdraw any of the bonus money.

# Wagers placed on certain types of bets do not count towards the wagering requirement. These include accumulator bets (parlay), system bets, and bets placed on odds of less than 2.0 (2/1).

# The bonus is valid for 30 days from the date that it is credited to your account. If you do not meet the requirements within this time period, the bonus will expire and will be removed from your account.
