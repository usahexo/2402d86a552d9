#  You Could Pay As Much As 39.6% On Your Casino Winnings

Americans that like to gamble and win could be looking at a large tax bill when they receive their casino earnings. Depending on the state, there can be taxes withheld from winnings at the casino – and in some cases, the rate is quite high.

In Missouri, for instance, gambling winnings over $5,000 are subject to a 39.6% withholding tax. This rate is the highest in the country, but there are other states with significant rates as well. In New York, for example, any winnings over $1,200 are subject to a 8.82% withholding tax.

This tax can create quite a financial burden for someone that hits it big at the casino – especially if they weren’t expecting it. In some cases, it can also lead to people cashing out their winnings earlier than they may have intended in order to minimize the amount of money that goes to the government.

While there are certainly situations where gambling can lead to big wins, it’s important to be aware of these taxes before heading to the casino. Knowing what your state’s withholding rate is can help you make better decisions about how much you want to gamble, and ensure that you don’t get taken by surprise when you do hit it big.
